# SvgToImage!
A program that converts SVG images to PNG/JPEG/TIFF/TGA, written in Java using the Processing creative coding framework!

Processing Libraries made by very the friendly community this program puts to use!:
- [Drop `1.0.2`](http://transfluxus.github.io/drop/)
- [UiBooster `1.15.2`](https://github.com/milchreis/UiBooster)

:)

This was probably *the second time* in my life I wrote actual software that could be used by *the common man* on a day-to-day basis.<br>
GPLv3 is the used license!

# Plans

- CLI Mode! Since I provide the application as a single JAR file and not as a [Launch4j](https://launch4j.sourceforge.net/) wrapped executable, 
  I can *actually* make a command line version, code for which is can bee seen in [`CliMode.pde`](https://github.com/Brahvim/SvgToImage/blob/main/CliMode.pde)
