# SvgToImage!
A program to convert SVG images to PNG/JPEG/TIFF/TGA, written in Java using the Processing creative coding framework!

Processing Libraries made by very the friendly community this program puts to use!:
- [Drop `1.0.2`](http://transfluxus.github.io/drop/)
- [UiBooster `1.15.2`](https://github.com/milchreis/UiBooster)

:)

This was probably *the second time* in my life I wrote actual software that could be used by *the common man* on a day-to-day basis.

# Licensing:
The "GNU GPLv3" is the license this program is distributed under.
You may also refer to newer versions of the GNU GPL!

![License Terms, SIMPLIFIED!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69293652/194105814-35256e15-7c4f-4c46-84b9-c50c84c542c2.png)

One instance of the license itself is available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Brahvim/SvgToImage/main/LICENSE.

# Things needed before installation:
Please make sure you have Java installed! The Oracle JDK you would usually get from https://java.com/download *should* work, but I recommend using OpenJDK binaries from https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases.


**Please make sure the "Package Type" is "JRE" and you have chosen correct settings for your computer!**
![Adoptium website](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69293652/194105344-23ead1ee-a611-45f9-90c1-e652f3764f86.png)

You are recommended to use the latest version of the JRE, but for guaranteed compatibility with this application, you may choose to use JRE 8.

# How to install SvgToImage:

# How to use:

# Plans:
- CLI Mode! Since I provide the application as a single JAR file and not as a [Launch4j](https://launch4j.sourceforge.net/) wrapped executable, 
  I can *actually* make a command line version, code for which is can bee seen in [`CliMode.pde`](https://github.com/Brahvim/SvgToImage/blob/main/CliMode.pde)
